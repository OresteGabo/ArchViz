# ArchViz Pro System 🏗️👓

> **"Seeing is not experiencing."** > Bridging the gap between technical blueprints and human experience through 1:1 scale VR/XR.

## 🌟 The Vision
The ArchViz project was born from a real-world frustration: technical plans and 3D renders on a screen fail to convey the **true sense of space**. As a non-engineer, I realized that looking at a layout isn't the same as living in it. 

This platform allows users to bring their **exact physical dimensions** into a digital twin of their future home to answer critical ergonomic questions:
- Can I reach the top shelf of this cabinet?
- Is this doorway wide enough for my comfort?
- Does the room's ergonomics match my morphology?

## 🛠️ Key Technical Features
- **Biometric Viewport Scaling**: Adjusts the XR camera height based on real-world user dimensions (Adult, Child, etc.) for accurate ergonomic testing.
- **1:1 Scale Locomotion**: Synchronized movement system to ensure that physical steps match virtual displacement.
- **Multi-Source BIM Integration**: Architected to support runtime imports from **Revit, ArchiCAD, Blender, FBX, and glTF**.
- **Modular C# Architecture**: Built with a decoupled, interface-based design (SOLID principles) for high scalability and clean code.

## 💻 Tech Stack
- **Engine**: Unity 6 (Optimized for Apple Silicon M4)
- **Language**: C# (Advanced OOP, Interfaces, ScriptableObjects)
- **XR Framework**: Unity XR Interaction Toolkit & OpenXR
- **Development Environment**: JetBrains Rider

## 📁 Project Structure
- `Core/`: Orchestrates the different modules of the application.
- `Systems/`: Specialized logic for height adjustment, navigation, and asset loading.
- `Interfaces/`: Ensures a strict contract for modular system expansion.
- `Data/`: ScriptableObjects for easy, code-free configuration.

## 🚀 Roadmap & Progress
- [x] Core Framework Architecture (Interface-based)
- [x] Biometric Height Profiles (Adult/Child toggles)
- [x] Runtime Asset Loader Infrastructure
- [ ] Direct ArchiCAD/Revit API Bridge
- [ ] Lighting & Morning Sun Simulation

## 🤝 Collaboration
I am actively looking to collaborate with **Developers, Architects, and Civil Engineers** to push the boundaries of PropTech.
